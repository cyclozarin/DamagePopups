# DamagePopups

Whenether player had taken damage, healed, revived or killed instantly, a popup indicating how much health was changed will appear for 3 seconds and slowly fade out

Note that popups may stuck in the objects or be in weird position because the position of *where* player was damaged/healed is not tracked by the game, so popups appears above head and moves towards random position.
